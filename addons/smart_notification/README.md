# Smart Notification for Odoo 18

## Revolutionary Notification Management

Take complete control of your Odoo notifications with user-configurable global preferences that work automatically across all records you follow.

## The Problem We Solve

In standard Odoo, you must configure notification preferences for EACH record you follow individually. Following 100 tasks? That's 100 manual configurations. 

**Smart Notification changes everything:** Configure once, apply everywhere.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Global Preferences
- Set your notification preferences ONCE in your user profile
- Automatically applied to EVERY record you follow
- No more repetitive configuration

### ðŸ‘¤ Smart Profiles
- **Minimal**: Only critical notifications
- **Normal**: Standard business notifications  
- **Manager**: Comprehensive updates
- **Board Member**: Everything including internal notes
- **Custom**: Granular control per model

### ðŸ”„ Intelligent Defaults
When you follow any record, your preferences are automatically applied:
- Tasks: Choose messages, notes, state changes, assignments
- Sales: Configure order confirmations, messages
- Invoices: Set validation and payment notifications

### ðŸŽ¨ Perfect Integration
- Works WITH Odoo's architecture, not against it
- Zero core modifications
- Maintains per-record override capability
- Full compatibility with Odoo 18
